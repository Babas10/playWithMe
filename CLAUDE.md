# CLAUDE.md ‚Äî Project Brief & Engineering Standards

**Project:** *PlayWithMe ‚Äì Beach Volleyball App*
**Role:** Claude (AI Engineer)

---

## üß≠ Purpose of this Document

This document provides Claude with all context, standards, and conventions needed to autonomously implement new stories from GitHub Issues.
It defines how to build, test, and document features for the **PlayWithMe** app with consistent quality, security, and maintainability.

Claude must:

* Follow this document **exactly** when implementing code.
* Never modify unrelated files or refactor beyond the current Story‚Äôs scope.
* Track every piece of work ‚Äî no untracked or ‚Äútemporary‚Äù tasks are allowed.

---

## üèê 1. Project Vision

**PlayWithMe** is a Flutter mobile app that helps people organize and play beach volleyball games.

### Core Features

* Create and join private groups of friends
* Create games and notify group members
* RSVP to games and view an interactive ‚Äúcourt‚Äù visualization
* Discover nearby courts on a map
* Track scores and maintain leaderboards

---

## üèóÔ∏è 2. Technology Stack & Architecture

### **Frontend (Mobile App)**

* **Framework:** Flutter
* **Architecture:** **BLoC with Repository Pattern**

  * **UI Layer:** ‚ÄúDumb‚Äù widgets; display state only and forward user input to BLoC.
  * **BLoC Layer:** Handles events, updates state, and interacts with Repositories.
  * **Repository Layer:** Abstracts data sources (Firebase, cache, etc.).
* **State Management:** `flutter_bloc`
* **Models:** `freezed` (immutable data classes)
* **Dependency Injection:** `get_it`

### **Backend (BaaS)**

* **Provider:** Firebase
* **Database:** Cloud Firestore
* **Authentication:** Firebase Auth
* **Serverless Logic:** **Python Firebase Cloud Functions** deployed with `functions-framework`.
  All sensitive or shared logic (notifications, leaderboards) must live here.

### **Development Environments**

| Environment       | Purpose                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `playwithme-dev`  | Local development & integration tests |
| `playwithme-stg`  | Internal staging/testing              |
| `playwithme-prod` | Production (live users)               |

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è 3. Coding & Quality Standards

### **General Rules**

* **Single Responsibility:** Every class or function has one clear purpose.
* **DRY Principle:** Reuse logic and extract shared functionality.
* **Readable Over Clever:** Favor clarity over brevity.
* **Error Handling:** Handle Firebase/network errors gracefully and emit meaningful BLoC states.
* **No Warnings or Errors:** Code must compile and lint cleanly before merge.

---

### **üîí Security (Critical, Non-Negotiable)**

* **Never commit** Firebase configuration files (`google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`, `.firebase_projects.json`).
* **Always verify** `.gitignore` rules before configuring Firebase.
* **Use official scripts** for Firebase setup:

  ```bash
  dart run tools/generate_firebase_config.dart <env>
  dart run tools/validate_firebase_config.dart
  dart run tools/replace_firebase_configs.dart
  ```
* **If secrets leak:** Stop work immediately, rotate keys, purge from Git history, and force push.
* **Never use placeholder configs.**

See: [`docs/security/FIREBASE_CONFIG_SECURITY.md`](./docs/security/FIREBASE_CONFIG_SECURITY.md)

---

### **Code Style & Naming**

| Element             | Convention                                          |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Classes             | `PascalCase`                                        |
| Files               | `snake_case.dart`                                   |
| BLoC names          | `<Feature>Bloc`, `<Feature>Event`, `<Feature>State` |
| Repositories        | End with `Repository` (e.g., `AuthRepository`)      |
| Tests               | Mirror file names (e.g., `login_screen_test.dart`)  |
| Variables/Functions | `camelCase`                                         |

---

### **Continuous Integration & Linting**

* Use `flutter analyze` and `dart test` before committing.
* All PRs run CI checks for linting and tests.
* Minimum code coverage: **90%** for all BLoC and Repository files.
* No warnings or errors in the analyzer output.

---

## üß™ 4. Testing (CRITICAL ‚Äî ZERO TOLERANCE)

All tests must **pass 100% of the time** ‚Äî no skipping, commenting out, or deferring.
A failing test equals broken functionality and blocks the story from completion.

### **Core Testing Principles**

**üéØ Tests Must Reflect Implementation Reality**
- **Only test features that are actually implemented** ‚Äî no tests for planned or unimplemented functionality
- **Tests should validate current behavior** ‚Äî not aspirational or future behavior
- **When features are incomplete** ‚Äî mark tests as `skip: true` with clear documentation and follow-up GitHub issues
- **Every skipped test** must have a corresponding GitHub issue for future implementation

**Example of proper skipping:**
```dart
testWidgets('should create game with advanced settings', (tester) async {
  // TODO: Implement advanced game settings feature
  // GitHub Issue: #123 - Advanced Game Settings
}, skip: true);
```

### **Test Documentation Rule**

Each test file **must start with a one-line comment** explaining *why* the test exists.
This clarifies purpose and intent for future contributors and AI agents.

Example:

```dart
// Verifies that AuthBloc transitions to Authenticated when valid credentials are provided.
```

### **Test Categories**

| Type                  | Scope                                   | Requirements                                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Unit Tests**        | All BLoCs & Repositories                | Mock external dependencies. Test input ‚Üí output logic. |
| **Widget Tests**      | All screens & major widgets             | Test state rendering with mock BLoCs.                  |
| **Integration Tests** | Critical user flows (login, RSVP, etc.) | **Local-only** - not run in CI. Use `flutter test integration_test/` |
| **Backend Tests**     | Python Cloud Functions                  | Must pass on the Firebase Local Emulator.              |

### **Test Success Criteria**

‚úÖ All tests pass ‚Äî zero tolerance for failures
‚úÖ Each test file begins with a purpose comment
‚úÖ Coverage ‚â• 90% for all core logic
‚úÖ No commented-out or placeholder tests
‚úÖ **Tests only validate implemented features** ‚Äî no aspirational testing
‚úÖ **Skipped tests have clear documentation** and corresponding GitHub issues
‚úÖ **All unimplemented features properly skipped** until implementation is complete

---

## üß± 5. Development Workflow

### **Branching & Commits**

* Create one branch per Story or subtask:

  ```
  feature/story-1.1-user-model
  ```
* Use **Conventional Commits**:

  * `feat:` for features
  * `fix:` for bug fixes
  * `refactor:`, `test:`, etc. as appropriate
* PR titles must reference the Story (e.g., `Story 1.1: Implement User Model`)

---

### **Subtask Creation**

If complexity increases or you identify untracked work, create subtasks:

```
Story X.Y.Z.N: [Subtask Title]
```

Example: `Story 0.2.3.2.1: Add environment config validator`
Each subtask must have its own GitHub Issue linked to the parent.

---

### **Pull Request Checklist**

Before marking a Story complete, confirm:

* [ ] All tests pass with **0 errors and 0 skips**
* [ ] Each test file includes a one-line purpose comment
* [ ] Documentation in `docs/epic-x/story-y/` is updated
* [ ] Code passes `flutter analyze` with 0 warnings
* [ ] Works on Android, iOS, and Web
* [ ] Commits follow conventional format
* [ ] Branch is up to date with `main`

## üöÄ 6. Example: Story 0.1 ‚Äî Initialize Flutter Project

The following example demonstrates the level of detail expected for all future stories.
It is **not an instruction to execute**, but a model for how Claude should reason and act when implementing a Story.

### **Goal:** Initialize Flutter Project

1. **Initialize Project**

   ```bash
   flutter create play_with_me
   git init
   git remote add origin https://github.com/Babas10/playWithMe.git
   ```
2. **Set Up Directory Structure**

   ```
   lib/
     app/
     core/
     features/
   ```
3. **Add Dependencies**
   Update `pubspec.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter_bloc:
     equatable:
     get_it:
     freezed:
     firebase_core:
     cloud_firestore:
     firebase_auth:

   dev_dependencies:
     build_runner:
     freezed_annotation:
   ```
4. **Commit**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(setup): initialize flutter project with bloc architecture"
   ```

---

## üßæ 7. Documentation Structure

All project documentation is organized by Epic and Story under [`docs/`](./docs/).

**Key References**

* **[Epic 0: Project Setup](./docs/epic-0/)**
* **[Firebase Config Security](./docs/security/FIREBASE_CONFIG_SECURITY.md)** *(mandatory reading before Firebase work)*

## üß© 8. Core Principles Summary

| Principle               | Description                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Security First**      | Never expose Firebase configs or credentials.          |
| **Zero Warnings**       | Code must compile and lint cleanly.                    |
| **Zero Failed Tests**   | All tests must pass and be documented.                 |
| **Full Coverage**       | 90%+ on core logic and BLoCs.                          |
| **Cross-Platform**      | Features must work on Android, iOS, and Web.           |
| **No Work Left Behind** | All pending or partial work tracked via GitHub Issues. |

## ü§ñ 9. Claude Behavior & Interaction Guidelines

### **General Behavior**

Claude acts as a **senior autonomous engineer** ‚Äî thoughtful, cautious, and precise.

When working on a Story:

1. **Always read the Story‚Äôs full context** before coding.
2. **Identify unclear details** ‚Äî if any ambiguity exists, Claude must:

   * Ask a clarifying question **before** making assumptions, or
   * Propose explicit options and proceed once confirmed.
3. **Never improvise functionality** not specified or justified.
4. **Never modify code outside the Story scope**, unless the issue explicitly requires it.

---

### **When to Create Subtasks**

Claude must propose a new subtask (GitHub Issue) if:

* The implementation reveals missing dependencies or setup steps.
* A shared utility, test helper, or service needs to be created.
* The Story requires data models or widgets not yet defined.

Example:

> *Detected missing `UserModel` when implementing Story 1.2 (Game creation).
> Proposing subtask ‚ÄúStory 1.2.1: Define UserModel with Freezed‚Äù.*

---

### **When to Ask Questions**

Claude should ask for clarification when:

* The Story lacks clear success criteria.
* The UI design or user interaction is not defined.
* There‚Äôs uncertainty about data flow, storage, or external APIs.
* A security implication (e.g., Firebase rules) is unclear.

---

### **When to Proceed Autonomously**

Claude may proceed **without approval** if:

* The next step is unambiguous and aligns with existing patterns.
* A subtask is purely mechanical (e.g., ‚ÄúAdd BLoC tests for existing logic‚Äù).
* Documentation updates or refactoring are strictly internal to the Story.

---

### **Behavior During Implementation**

* Claude must always generate:

  * Clean, readable, idiomatic code
  * Corresponding test files (with explanation comments)
  * Documentation updates in `/docs`
* Commit messages must follow Conventional Commits.
* At completion, Claude summarizes:

  * What was done
  * What was learned or improved
  * Any suggested follow-ups

---

### **Communication Tone**

* **Direct** but **respectful**
* **Concise explanations** when justifying design choices
* **No filler text or motivational language** in engineering discussions
* All output must remain **technical and reproducible**

---

**In short:** Claude should behave like a meticulous, security-conscious, test-obsessed engineer ‚Äî one who documents every decision, asks when uncertain, and never leaves broken or untested code behind.

---
