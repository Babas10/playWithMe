# Story 0.2.3.2.4: Update Widget Test Expectations to Match New Authentication Flow

## Overview

Updated widget test expectations to align with the new authentication-based app flow instead of expecting old static HomePage content.

## Problem

Widget tests were expecting old UI elements ("Welcome to PlayWithMe!", static environment text) but the app now shows authentication flow (splash → login → authenticated states).

## Solution

- Updated `test/widget_test.dart` to test actual `LoginPage` widget instead of hardcoded UI simulation
- Fixed text expectations to match actual login page content ("Sign in to continue organizing your volleyball games")
- Added comprehensive authentication state transition test in `test/app/play_with_me_app_test.dart`
- Verified proper state transitions (Unknown → Unauthenticated → UI update)

## Files Modified

- `test/widget_test.dart`: Updated to test real LoginPage widget with correct authentication UI elements
- `test/app/play_with_me_app_test.dart`: Added comprehensive authentication state transition test

## Tests

All widget tests now pass (10/10) and properly validate:
- Authentication UI elements ("Welcome Back!", "Sign in to continue organizing your volleyball games")
- Proper state transitions from splash → login → authenticated states
- Environment-specific behavior with authentication flow
- Real widget behavior instead of hardcoded simulations

## Test Coverage

- ✅ PlayWithMeApp renders correctly in all environments with authentication flow
- ✅ Authentication state transitions work properly (Unknown → Unauthenticated → Authenticated)
- ✅ LoginPage shows correct authentication UI elements
- ✅ Environment-specific tests work with authentication flow
- ✅ HomePage tests remain valid for authenticated users

## Acceptance Criteria Met

- [x] Tests expect correct authentication UI elements
- [x] Tests verify proper state transitions
- [x] Environment-specific tests work with authentication flow
- [x] All app widget tests pass with correct expectations
