# Story 1.4.5: Account Settings & Preferences

## 📋 Overview

This story implements a comprehensive account settings and preferences system for the Gatherli app. Due to the breadth of functionality and different technical concerns, this story has been decomposed into **5 focused substories** to ensure maintainability, clear testing boundaries, and manageable implementation scope.

**Parent Story**: #[Story 1.4.5]
**Epic**: User Profile Management (Epic 1.4)
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress (Decomposed into substories)

---

## 🎯 Rationale for Decomposition

The original Story 1.4.5 combined five distinct areas of concern:

1. **User Preferences** (notifications, theme, language)
2. **Privacy & Visibility** (profile visibility, contact preferences)
3. **Security** (password change, sessions, 2FA)
4. **Data Management** (export, delete, cache)
5. **UI/UX** (settings shell, search, navigation)

Each area touches different parts of the stack:
- Firebase (security & user data)
- SharedPreferences (local storage)
- Cloud sync logic (Firestore)
- System integrations (notifications, themes)
- Platform APIs (mobile vs web)

Combining all of these into a single story would:
- ❌ Blow up implementation scope
- ❌ Create overly complex test coverage requirements
- ❌ Make code review extremely difficult
- ❌ Introduce too many dependencies at once
- ❌ Risk integration issues between unrelated features

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Each substory maintains **90%+ test coverage** across:

### Unit Tests
- BLoC state transitions
- Repository operations
- Data persistence logic
- Error handling

### Widget Tests
- UI component rendering
- User interactions (toggles, buttons)
- Dialog confirmations
- Accessibility

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end flows
- Cloud sync verification
- Platform-specific behaviors

## 📱 Platform Support

- ✅ Android
- ✅ iOS
- ✅ Web

Each substory includes platform-specific considerations where applicable.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Story 1.4.5.1 (Preferences)
- No sensitive data
- Local storage only

### Story 1.4.5.2 (Privacy)
- Profile visibility enforcement
- Server-side validation of privacy settings

### Story 1.4.5.3 (Security)
- **Critical**: Re-authentication required
- Rate limiting on sensitive operations
- Secure token handling
- Audit logging for security events

### Story 1.4.5.4 (Data Management)
- Export data must be encrypted
- Deletion is irreversible (requires confirmation)
- Compliance with GDPR/CCPA

## 👥 Notes

- Start with Story 1.4.5.1 (simplest, no dependencies)
- Story 1.4.5.3 requires extra security review
- Story 1.4.5.5 should be implemented last (integrates all)
- Each substory can be reviewed and merged independently
