## ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps

**Story 0.2.1 is COMPLETE** - you can now proceed with:

1. **Story 0.2.2**: ‚úÖ Also appears to be complete (config files replaced)
2. **Story 0.2.3**: Configure Firebase Services (Authentication, Firestore)
3. **Story 0.2.4**: Test Real Firebase Connection
4. **Story 0.2.5**: Validation & Verification

**Note**: The Flutter flavor configuration (environment-specific entry points like `main_dev.dart`) needs to be implemented to enable the `flutter build --flavor dev` command to work. This was part of the original Story 0.2 setup.

## üèÜ Conclusion

**Story 0.2.1: Create Real Firebase Projects** has been successfully completed. All three Firebase projects are created, configured, and ready for use. The foundation for multi-environment development is now in place.
